# DevOps Portfolio Projects - Implementation Guide

This repository contains 5 beginner-to-intermediate DevOps projects designed to help you build a job-winning portfolio. Each project is organized in its own folder with step-by-step implementation instructions.

## ✅ Project 1: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

**Tools:** Terraform, Azure CLI, Azure Container Instances

### Steps:

1. Install Azure CLI and Terraform
2. Create a free Azure account
3. Login to Azure using `az login`
4. Clone this repo and go to `project-1-infrastructure`
5. Copy and edit `terraform.tfvars` with your config (e.g., resource group name and location)
6. Run `terraform init` to initialize
7. Run `terraform plan` to preview
8. Run `terraform apply` to deploy
9. Get public IP from `terraform output` and test in browser or via `curl`
10. Destroy resources using `terraform destroy`

## ✅ Project 2: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

**Tools:** GitHub Actions, Node.js, Docker, Azure Container Registry

### Steps:

1. Install Node.js and Docker Desktop
2. Clone this repo and go to `project-2-cicd-pipeline`
3. Run `npm install` and `npm start` to test locally
4. Build Docker image with `docker build -t my-webapp .`
5. Push code to GitHub repository
6. Run `azure_setup.sh` to create ACR and service principal
7. Add required secrets to GitHub Actions: `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`, `ACR_NAME`, etc.
8. Trigger workflow by pushing code to main branch
9. Get public URL from GitHub Actions or Azure CLI
10. Modify and push again to see auto-deployment
11. Clean up Azure resources with `az group delete`

## ✅ Project 3: Container Orchestration with Kubernetes

**Tools:** Kubernetes (Docker Desktop or Minikube), kubectl

### Steps:

1. Enable Kubernetes via Docker Desktop or install Minikube
2. Install `kubectl`
3. Build Docker image for the app
4. Navigate to `project-3-kubernetes` and apply `k8s/app.yaml`
5. Wait for pods to be ready
6. Access the app via `minikube service`, port-forwarding, or localhost
7. Test scaling, self-healing by deleting pods
8. Clean up with `kubectl delete -f k8s/app.yaml`

## ✅ Project 4: Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

**Tools:** Docker Compose, Prometheus, Grafana

### Steps:

1. Navigate to `project-4-monitoring`
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start monitoring stack
3. Visit Prometheus at `http://localhost:9090`
4. Visit Grafana at `http://localhost:3000` (admin/admin)
5. Add Prometheus as data source in Grafana
6. Create basic dashboards or import from grafana.com (e.g., ID 1860)
7. Monitor Node.js app from project 2
8. Set up alerts in Grafana
9. Stop monitoring stack using `docker-compose down`

---

## ✅ Project 5: Multi-Environment Infrastructure

**Tools:** Terraform Modules, Azure CLI

### Steps:

1. Navigate to `project-5-multi-environment`
2. Explore the folder structure: `modules/` and `environments/dev` & `environments/prod`
3. Go to `environments/dev` and run `terraform init` → `apply`
4. Add outputs to module to expose public IP/URL if not already present
5. Access the app via browser or `curl`
6. Repeat same steps for `environments/prod`
7. Verify isolation by changing container image in dev only
8. Practice shared updates by adding variables to the module
9. Destroy both environments using `terraform destroy`

## ✅ Final Notes

Each project folder includes its own `README.md` with tailored instructions, configs, and screenshots where applicable.

Be sure to:
* Customize the `.tfvars`, `.yml`, or YAML files to fit your use case

Happy building! 🚀
